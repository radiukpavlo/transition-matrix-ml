    "1. **Regularization techniques** - You could use [dropout on your neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_(neural_networks)), dropout involves randomly removing neurons in different layers so that the remaining neurons hopefully learn more robust weights/patterns.\n",
    "2. **Use a different model** - maybe the model you're using for a specific problem is too complicated, as in, it's learning the data too well because it has so many layers. You could remove some layers to simplify your model. Or you could pick a totally different model altogether, one that may be more suited to your particular problem. Or... you could also use [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) (taking the patterns from one model and applying them to your own problem).\n",
    "3. **Reduce noise in data/cleanup dataset/introduce data augmentation techniques** - If the model is learning the data too well, it might be just memorizing the data, including the noise. One option would be to remove the noise/clean up the dataset or if this doesn't, you can introduce artificial noise through the use of data augmentation to artificially increase the diversity of your training dataset."
